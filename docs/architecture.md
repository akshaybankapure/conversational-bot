# Conversational Bot Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the Conversational Bot system, designed for strict, role-based, and high-performance conversational AI. The system is modular, secure, and optimized for fast response times.

## Core Components
- **Frontend Chat UI**: Temporary React-based chat interface for user interaction.
- **Backend API (Node.js)**: Handles chat orchestration, session management, and routing.
- **Smart Router**: Decides the optimal processing path (cache, semantic search, LLM, etc.) for each query.
- **Semantic Fastpath**: Embedding-based similarity search for FAQs and known queries.
- **LLM/ASR Modules**: Pluggable modules for language and speech processing.
- **Cache**: Fast, role/user-scoped cache for semantic and response data.
- **Session Manager**: Manages per-user, per-role session context.

## High-Level Flow
1. **User Input**: User sends a message via the chat UI.
2. **Session & Role Validation**: Backend ensures session and role are valid and isolated.
3. **Smart Routing**: The Smart Router selects the optimal processing path:
   - **Semantic Cache/Fastpath**: For known queries, returns cached/FAQ answers instantly.
   - **Semantic Search**: For similar queries, finds best FAQ match.
   - **LLM/ASR**: For novel/complex queries, invokes pluggable LLM/ASR modules.
4. **Response Generation**: The system generates a response, updates session context, and caches as needed.
5. **Frontend Display**: The response is streamed/displayed in the chat UI.

## Security & Role Isolation
- **Strict Role/User Partitioning**: All caches, context, and session data are strictly partitioned by user and role.
- **No Cross-Role/User Leakage**: Backend enforces strict access control; no data is shared between roles or users.
- **Session Tokens**: Every API call requires a valid session token, tied to user and role.

## Extensibility
- **Modular LLM/ASR**: Swap in local or API-based LLM/ASR modules without changing core logic.
- **Pluggable Cache/Store**: Move from in-memory to Redis or other stores as needed.

## Performance
- **Semantic Fastpath**: Known queries are answered in milliseconds.
- **Streaming**: LLM responses can be streamed for fast first-token output.
- **Async Ops**: Analytics, predictive caching, and index updates run asynchronously.

## Next Steps
- Implement detailed module/class diagrams.
- Document API endpoints and data flows.
